All binaries are **unmodified**, taken verbatim from the official BepInEx release

## LGPL-2.1 note

BepInEx is LGPL-2.1. It is redistributed here unmodified and unlinked — this project's plugin
is a separate work that BepInEx loads at runtime. The complete corresponding source for BepInEx
is publicly available at the upstream URL above, at the tagged release named in this file.

If you would prefer to obtain BepInEx yourself, use the plugin-only archive
(`FrankensteinPCVRFix-<version>.zip`) instead; it contains no third-party code.

## Not redistributed

- **Frankenstein: Beyond the Time game files** — property of The Dust. The plugin is built against
  your own installed copy, and nothing on disk is modified.
- **SteamVR / OpenVR and the Oasis Driver for Windows Mixed Reality** — neither included nor modified.
